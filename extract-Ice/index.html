<p>Zinit has a swiss-knife tool for unpacking all kinds of archives &#8211; the
<code>extract''</code> ice. It works in two modes &#8211; automatic mode and fixed mode.</p>
<h2 id="automatic_mode">Automatic Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic_mode" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>It is active if the ice is empty (or contains only flags &#8211; more on them later).
It works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>At first, a recursive search for files of known <a href="#supported_file_formats">file
   extensions</a> located not deeper than in
   a sub-directory is being performed. All such found files are then extracted.<ul>
<li>The directory-level limit is to skip extraction of some helper archive
  files, which are typically located somewhere deeper in the directory tree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IF</strong> no such files will be found, then a recursive search for files of
   known archive <strong>types</strong> will be performed. This is basically done by running
   the <code>file</code> Unix command on each file in the plugin or snippet directory and
   then grepping the output for strings like <code>Zip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>, etc. All such
   discovered files are then extracted.<ul>
<li>The directory-level requirement is imposed also during this stage - files
  located deeper in the tree than in a sub-directory are omitted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If no archive files will be discovered then no action is being performed and
   also no warning message is being printed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fixed_mode">Fixed Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed_mode" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>It is active when a filename is being passed as the <code>extract</code>'s argument, e.g.:
<code>zinit extract=archive.zip for zdharma/null</code>. Multiple files can be specified
&#8211; separated by spaces. In this mode all and only the specified files are being
extracted.</p>
<h4 id="filenames_with_spaces">Filenames With Spaces<a class="headerlink" href="#filenames_with_spaces" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>The filenames with spaces in them are supported by a trick &#8211; to correctly pass
such a filename to <code>extract</code> use the non-breaking space in place of the
in-filename original spaces. The non-breaking space is easy to type by pressing
right Alt and the Space.</p>
<h2 id="flags">Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#flags" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The value of the ice can begin with a two special characters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exclamation mark (<code>!</code>), i.e.: <code>extract='!&#8230;'</code> &#8211; it'll cause the files to be
   moved one directory-level up upon unpacking,</li>
<li>Dash (<code>-</code>), i.e.: <code>extract'-&#8230;'</code> &#8211; it'll prevent removal of the archive after
   unpacking.<ul>
<li>This flag is useful to allow comparing timestamps with the server in case
  of snippet-downloaded file &#8211; it will prevent unnecessary downloads during
  <code>zinit update</code>, as the timestamp of the archive file on the disk will be
  first compared with the HTTP last-modification time header.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The flags can be combined in any order, e.g.: <code>extract'!-'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ziextract_function"><code>ziextract</code> Function<a class="headerlink" href="#ziextract_function" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a more uncommon unpacking operation is needed. In such case you can
directly use the function that implements the ice &#8211; it is called <code>ziextract</code>. It
recognizes the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>--auto</code> &#8211; runs the automatic extraction.</li>
<li><code>--move</code> &#8211; performs the one-directory-level-up move of the files after
   unpacking.</li>
<li><code>--norm</code> - prevents the archive file removal.</li>
<li>And also one option specific only to the function: <code>--nobkp</code>, which prevents
   clearing of the plugin's dir before the extraction &#8211; normally all the files
   except the archive are being moved into <code>._backup</code> directory and after that
   the extraction is performed.<ul>
<li><code>extract</code> ice also skips creating the backup <strong>if</strong> more than one archive
  is found or given as the argument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
